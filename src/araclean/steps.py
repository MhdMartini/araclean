A `Step` is the minimal contract (a `safety` class + `__call__`), so a user can drop in their
own `str -> str` callable (story 47). Each built-in step's behavior is also exported as a free
function for standalone use (Layer 1, ADR-0003).

Built-in steps additionally serialize themselves (`to_dict`/`from_dict`) and register under a
canonical name, so a `Pipeline` can be persisted and rehydrated. The serialization contract is

    - `min_run` — what counts as elongation: only a run of at least `min_run` copies collapses.
      Defaults to ``max(cap + 1, 3)``: Arabic spells true doubled letters constantly (the

      elongation signal (the literature's standard rule) and a double is presumed legitimate. A
      2-copy emphatic spelling is indistinguishable from a legitimate double without a lexicon, so
      it is deliberately left alone.
    - `cap` — what a run reduces to: ``cap=1`` (the default) collapses to the canonical single
      letter, so جمييييل merges with جميل (what ML/SEARCH want); ``cap=2`` keeps a doubled letter
      so emphasis survives as a feature (what SOCIAL wants — its trigger is already 3, so its

    Only contemporary Arabic letters are capped; digits are never touched (a repeated digit is a
    number, not emphasis, so 1000 stays 1000), nor are tashkeel marks or tatweel. The fold discards
    the emphasis, so `safety` is `LINGUISTIC_FOLDING`: opt-in via a lossy profile or an explicit

    pronouns, neutral conjunctions and particles — so high-frequency function words stop drowning
    out content words (IR/retrieval, bag-of-words features). It discards linguistic content from the
    Arabic text, so `safety` is `LINGUISTIC_FOLDING`: opt-in via a lossy profile or an explicit
    step, never under `LIGHT` (it is content removal, not non-linguistic-noise cleaning — ADR-0011).

    Two deliberate properties (story 37): the list is **flat, not clitic-aware** (ADR-0001), so a
    prefixed/suffixed form like ``والكتاب`` / ``فيها`` is kept — only a standalone token is removed;
    and it is **negation-safe** — the polarity particles ``ما`` / ``لا`` / ``لم`` / ``لن`` / ``ليس``
    are excluded so removal can never flip a sentence's polarity. A removed token leaves its
    whitespace as written (a gap), like the other delete-style steps (CleanURLs); a later
    `CollapseWhitespace` tidies the gaps. The list version is serialized so a `Profile` pins it
    reproducibly.

    ORDERING CONTRACT (enforced): the list ships in FOLDED form (`araclean.stopwords`), so this
    step must run AFTER dediacritization and the letter folds — `requires_before` names them, and
    `Pipeline` rejects at construction any pipeline where they do not precede this step. Folding
    first is what makes matching robust: real typed Arabic routinely omits hamza (انا، الى) and
    vocalized text never matches a bare list, but after `RemoveTashkeel` + `FoldAlef` +
    `FoldAlefMaqsura` + `FoldHamza` every spelling variant lands on the one folded form the list
    carries. The folds are idempotent and cheap, so a pipeline over already-normalized text simply

    the live UCD so it tracks Unicode releases. Symbols (S*: ``$ + = ~``), digits and letters are
    not punctuation and pass through. `keep` carves out characters to preserve (each entry one
    character).

    Distinct from `MapPunctuation` (which REWRITES the three Arabic sentence marks to their Latin
    equivalents for tokenizer uniformity): this step DELETES, so the two compose — map first if
    you want the Latin marks, or just remove everything. Deleting sentence structure is lossy, so

    `str.translate`, so it is fusible (0018).
